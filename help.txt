Shoe is a simple network boot configuration tool.
It helps you set up Linux networks for PXE booting.

***INSTRUCTIONS****

First install dhcpd, tftpd, and syslinux.
You'll also need FTP, HTTP, or NFS to serve kickstarts (if you want them)
And you'll also have to edit dhcpd.conf.


   yum install dhcp tftp-server syslinux
   ...
   vi /etc/dhcpd.conf

Verify that everything you need is set up.
This will mention missing/stopped services and configuration errors.
Errors?  Correct any problems it reports, then run it again.

   shoe check

Define your distributions, and give them names
A good example would be 'fc5-i386' or 'fc5-x86_64'
Paths should be on a mounted filesystem.

  shoe distro add --name="distro1" --kernel=path --initrd=path

Define your provisioning "groups", and give them names too.
Groups might be called 'webservers' or 'qamachines' or 'desktops'.
Each group needs to know it's distribution.
Kickstart can be done over NFS, FTP, or HTTP url, or just 'off'.

  shoe group add --name="group1" --distro="name1" --kickstart=url|off

Now add your systems to groups

  shoe system add --name=mac|ipaddr|hostname --group="group1"

Should you want to review things...

  shoe distros list 
  shoe groups list
  shoe systems list

Should you need to delete anything ...

  shoe distro remove --name="distro1"
  shoe group remove  --name="group1"
  shoe system remove --name=ipaddr|mac

Too much work?  If you're brave, you can also edit '/etc/shoe.conf'
Make a backup first. 

  vi /etc/shoe.conf

Now make all of that bootable (immediately)

  shoe sync -dryrun   # for the paranoid
  shoe sync 

That's it!
